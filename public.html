          <p>From previous research, we know that a primary reason for installing art in a city is that it increases the livability of a space. 
            People can feel a sense of connectedness to the community as well as the city. 
            It gives the city a landmark and people feel proud of living there. <br><br>

            Before our team got together as a group, each of us tried to understand the current state of public art using data from previous research. 
            We watched recordings of interviews, done experiential research and created stakeholder maps. 
            We were able to generate insights, create Usability Finding Templates (UFTs) and Data Visualizations.</p>

            <li>During the creation of the artwork, the general public cannot contribute to the final outcome.</li>
            <li>There are no interactions with the viewers. People often cannot do much with the art other than looking at it.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Our team also chose to do a reverse assumption activity in order to identify a problem space that we were interested in. The assumption we were most interested in was "public art is only created by artists" and its reversal. We wanted allow the public to be able to participate in the creation of the artwork in some way. If the general public has a voice during the creation process, it ensures that public art is representative of the people.

How might we foster that?" After every session, we held an interpretation session. </p>

          <ol>
            <li>The topic of public art has a perceived certain threshold that allows people to engage with or talk about it.
              <ul>
                <li>Depending on someone’s perceived threshold of the public art, he/she will engage with others about it. For example, those who believe that the topic of art is casual will perceive that conversing about art has a low threshold of entry (ref. A1-2 and A1-9).</li>
                <li>Quote: “I don’t feel comfortable talking about public art unless I know something about it”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The level of exposure to public art is influenced by people’s daily routines. We observed that the measure of how often one views public art is dependent on where people go on a daily basis.
              <ul>
                <li>The frequency of viewing public art is affected by one’s close proximity to pieces.</li>
                <li>For example, one observation from our interviews points to how location affects an artwork’s noticeability due to the artwork’s surroundings and other businesses that may be nearby (ref. V3-3)</li>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          The current state of public art has a problem: The intention of public art contradicts the reality of its experience.<br><br>

          The intention is that we see public art as something anyone can enjoy. There is no fee, no time limit and no barriers to enjoy public art. In other words, there is a low threshold of entry. However, the reality is that people think art has a high threshold of entry. People think that there are barriers between them and public art, which are preventing them from talking about public art with one another. The three barriers that we identified are: Prior Knowledge, Proximity, Privacy

          We found that people thought that they needed background knowledge to talk about public art with one another. They think that they need to be of a certain intellect or class to talk about it. These people also did know any suitable platform they can use to learn more about the art.<br>

          People confine their experience with public art to when they were proximally close the art piece. The experience of public art ends whenever they leave the site.

              <li>Users couldn’t easily identify the location of the art pieces (UFT’s #3 and #8).

              <li>It was not obvious that you could click on the comments.</li>
              <li>Users thought the magnifying glass icon was confusing. It looks like a search icon but is actually a navigation tool.</li>
              <li>Users wanted a marker for their location and estimated ETA for a nearby artwork.</li>

          <p>
            When I first met with my group members, I was afraid that I would not meet the group’s standards for the project. 
            Because I have never participated in any sort of research before, I did not know what to expect and was nervous the first time I interviewed a participant. 
            I was pushed out of my own comfort zone by recruiting interviewees and talking to strangers over zoom. 
            Looking back at the semester, I was proud of the work I have done.

            <li><strong>Interviews</strong><br>
              Because I was so nervous when I conducted the interview, I was worrying about whether everything would go well. I wanted to follow the interview guide thoroughly to make sure that I did not miss any important steps of the interview. I think that because I worried too much about the structure of the interview, I seemed uninterested during the interview. For the future, I will try to focus less on following the guide/structure and more on learning about the interviewee.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Designing Interfaces</strong><br>
              I have worked with Figma in the past for individual projects. This is the first time that I tried designing interfaces with a team. I was glad that I learned so much from my teammates because it was clear that they had a lot more experience than me. Because I have never taken a design course before, I was mentored on design principles while making the interfaces.</li>
