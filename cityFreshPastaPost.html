    <h1 class=heading1> City Fresh Pasta Site </h1> 

    <p class= bodyText> 
        For my marketing project, my group has to propose a marketing plan for a Pittsburgh based company. We chose City Fresh Pasta. When I saw their website, I thought that there could be several improvements. This is their old website:
    </p> <br>

    <img class= imageFull src= 'cityFreshPasta1.png'> <br><br><br>

    <p class= bodyText> 
        This is how I would change the website:
    </p><br>

    <img class=imageFull src='cityFreshPasta2.png'> 

    <p class= bodyText>
        I chose to go with the theme colors green and pasta yellow because of its existing logo. I thought that having theme colors will make it easier for customers to remember this restaurant.
        <br><br>
        For this project, I learned how to make the page scroll. When I was making the menu page, I knew I wanted to include pictures. Not just one picture, but as many pictures as customers need to decide if they want the item. I learned that cutting things off makes it clear for the user to know that there is more content, which makes them scroll.
        <br><br>
        I used the fix position when scrolling option for the menu bar. I noticed that many websites have this, and I thought that this is an easy way for users to have everything in one place even when they scroll down to view more content.
        <br><br>
        I tried recreating the City Fresh Pastaâ€™s logo. This was just to practice vector illustration.
        <br><br>
        It was very important that I used components for this project. Since I needed to create copies of a page, I needed to use components to make sure that I only need to make a change once and not for every copy.
