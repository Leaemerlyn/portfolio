    Hello, my name is Lea. This is my website. I like to drink coffee, but only decaf. I started off wanting to create a website as a resume type thing, but I changed my mind. I'd rather have an imaginary coffee shop. But... I guess you clicked on this link because you want to learn more about me. So, that is exactly what I'm gonna do! 

    Hello again. I am a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a business major hoping to double major in HCI. I enjoy being creative and I wish I went down a different path in my college career. I will probably be a much happier person if I were studying design. Here I am now, in a mid-college-life crisis, not knowing what to do. What if HCII don't wanna accept me. Gahhhh. It's fine though. I can always still learn everything that I can and hope... no. KNOW that I will get a UX designer job. YES YES YES. I will. 

    Okay if you're wondering how I look like here is a picture of me. 
</p>

    Wow, that was a silly photo. Why let the world know that I'm goofy? TEHEHEHE 

    Okay, here's another picture la~~
