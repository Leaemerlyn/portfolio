            Hello! I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University with a double major in Human Computer Interaction and Business. I hope to be a UX/UI designer and researcher in the future. Feel free to take a look at the projects I have worked on so far.

            (I coded this website myself and I am still working on this portfolio site. Soon, the projects page will populate with more details.)

        In a nutshell
    </h4>

    <p>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University double majoring in human-computer interaction and business. I look forward to becoming a full time UX/UI designer and researcher. Currently, I work at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at CMU as a research assistant. Feel free to take a look at some of the projects I have worked on. <br><br>

        I am a self-taught designer, and I learned how to use several design softwares through free online courses and applying the concepts in my personal projects. In my spare time, I also enjoy learning how to code in HTML/CSS.<br><br>

        P.S. I coded this portfolio on my own with the help of <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/" target= _blank>w3schools.com</a> and stackoverflow. I am deeply sorry if it looks a little broken on your screen resolution. I swear it looked decent on my 13 inch macbook. :)

    <p> <span style= "color:#E7685D"><b>Art </b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I've always been doodling, and all I use is an HB pencil and a piece of white paper. When I was 19, I purchased Adobe’s Creative Cloud subscription and started using Illustrator and Photoshop. I didn’t have any prior experience with graphics or design, so I simply googled “illustrator tutorials,” and learned from free videos. I'm still learning how to use these softwares, but feel free to take a look at <a href= artwork.html>my work</a>. <br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #57744B"><b>Dancing</b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I tried joining several dance organizations in CMU, but because I didn’t have any prior dance experience, none of the clubs would take me. I remembered how I kept seeing posters for the <a href= "http://www.cmubdc.org/" target= _blank>Ballroom Dance Club</a>, so I decided to give it a try. I was elected as the events coordinator my sophomore year and the public relations chair my junior year. <br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #00BBD6"><b>Events Planning </b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I was the events coordinator for the Ballroom Dance Club, and I organized team bonding activities such as apple picking, dumpling parties, end of year formal (Scotch Ball). I like to have fun and have things planned out wayyy ahead of time. <br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #ED1C24"><b>Traveling</b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">My family never went on a family vacation before, but I got enough scholarships that allowed me to study abroad twice. I went to Santiago, Dominican Republic in high school to study Spanish. During the summer of my freshman year of college, I went to Prague, Czech Republic to study Business and to intern at <a href="https://rossum.ai/" target= _blank>Rossum</a>. <br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #336633"><b>Wrestling</b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I joined the wrestling team at Brooklyn Technical High School because I’ve always been interested in martial arts, and I wanted to make some friends. I did not have any experience in wrestling, and was very embarrassed at how bad I was in the beginning. I joined the team as a junior, and stuck with it through senior year. I competed in both the boy’s team and the girls team. By senior year, I was captain of the girl’s team and second place in the city. <br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #3E7B7D"><b>Music</b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">I started playing the piano, flute, violin, viola and clarinet when I was in sixth grade. There was a free after school program called Smart Arts at my middle school, and I was able to learn different instruments from that program. My teachers were probably annoyed that I switched all the time :). When I got to high school, I continued to play the <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kuTmkOg3Q" target= _blank>flute</a> for an additional four years.<br><br></span>

        <span style= "color: #B14A5D"><b> Community Service </b></span><br>
        <span style= "color: #333132">Although I don’t do much of it now, I am always looking for ways I can get involved in community service. In high school, I did over 200 hours of community service. Last winter break, I volunteered for <a href= "https://www.habitat.org/" target= _blank>Habitat For Humanities</a> in Florida.</span><br><br>
