            Introduction
</h3>

<p>
I participated in my university’s Emerging Leaders Program during the spring semester of my freshmen year. This program brings groups of students together to improve on-campus life or do social good in the community. We were given the flexibility to focus on any topic we were interested in. During our first meeting, we all agreed that we have suffered from mental illness before or at least know people who have. 
</p>

<h3 style= "color: #9E2F2D; letter-spacing: 6px; padding-left: 130px">
            Why Is This Important?
</h3>

<p>
<ol class= "main">
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> Mental Illness is incredibly stigmatized</li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> Getting help is not often talked about, let alone encouraged </li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> We have great resources on campus, but they are underutilized</li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> More and more people are seeking guidance and assistance each year and the numbers only increase as the years go on</li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> We wanted to bring to light that people do use these resources, and they are beneficial</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3 style= "color: #9E2F2D; letter-spacing: 6px; padding-left: 130px">
           What We Did:
</h3>

<p>
On campus, there is a Mindfulness room where students can relax, do yoga and meditate. We decided to place a glass container with marbles in this room to show the number of people who utilized Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) this month. <br><br>

Next to the glass container, there is a note explaining the significance of the marbles. Students can also write anonymous messages next to the container. We hope that students can realize that those who suffer from mental illness are not alone.

<h3 style= "color: #9E2F2D; letter-spacing: 6px; padding-left: 130px">
         What we Hope to Accomplish:
</h3>

<p>
<ol class= "main">
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> We hope that Mental Health is recognized more within the CMU community and that the  Health Services are being taken advantage of. </li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> We believe that seeking help should not be something to be ashamed of and that there are services for a reason. It is in our best interests to take full advantage of them. </li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;"> We hope that people who aren’t using the mental health resources on campus who need them will feel comfortable doing so</li>
<li style = "padding-right: 150px;">We also want to create a sense that you are not alone </li>
</ol>
